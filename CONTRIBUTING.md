## Making Changes

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- **TypeScript changes**: Edit files in `src-public/`
- **Rust changes**: Edit files in `src/`
- **WIT interface changes**: Edit `wit/literate.wit` and regenerate bindings
- **Prompts**: Edit files in `prompts/`

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run the full test suite
make test

# Or run specific tests
npm run test
```

### 4. Format and Lint

```bash
# Format all code
make format

# Lint all code
make lint
```

## Submitting Changes

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Code follows the project's style guidelines
- [ ] Self-review of your code
- [ ] Code is properly commented
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed
- [ ] No merge conflicts

### Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: All PRs must pass CI checks
2. **Code Review**: At least one maintainer must approve
3. **Testing**: Changes must be tested thoroughly
4. **Documentation**: Updates must be clear and accurate

## Development Workflow

### Watch Mode

For active development, use watch mode:

```bash
make dev
```

This will:
- Watch TypeScript files and rebuild on changes
- Watch Rust files and rebuild WASM on changes
- Automatically regenerate bindings when WIT files change

### Building

```bash
# Full build
make build

# Individual components
make wasm          # Build WASM component
make typescript    # Build TypeScript
make bindings      # Generate TypeScript bindings
```

### Packaging

```bash
# Create VSIX package
make package
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test -- --grep "specific test"
```

### Test Coverage

We aim for high test coverage. When adding new features:

1. Write unit tests for new functions
2. Add integration tests for new workflows
3. Test error conditions and edge cases

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Rust

- Follow Rust naming conventions
- Use `cargo fmt` for formatting
- Use `cargo clippy` for linting
- Add documentation comments for public items

### General

- Keep functions small and focused
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for TypeScript functions
- Add Rust documentation comments for public items
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update this CONTRIBUTING.md for process changes

### API Documentation

- Document all public APIs
- Include examples where helpful
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

## Release Process

1. **Version Bump**: Update version in `package.json` and `Cargo.toml`
2. **Changelog**: Update CHANGELOG.md with new features/fixes
3. **Build**: Run `make build` to ensure everything compiles
4. **Test**: Run full test suite
5. **Package**: Create VSIX package with `make package`
6. **Publish**: Publish to VS Code Marketplace
